# IBKR Connection Configuration
# ================================

# Primary connection method - automatically detects best option
# The system will try in order: Gateway (4001), TWS (7496), Proxy (5055)
USE_IBKR_GATEWAY=true  # Set to false to prefer TWS over Gateway

# IBKR Gateway Configuration (Recommended for API access)
# Client Portal Gateway runs on port 5000 by default
IBKR_GATEWAY_PORT=5000

# IBKR Trader Workstation Configuration (Alternative)
# TWS runs on port 7496 (default) or 7497 (paper trading)
IBKR_TWS_PORT=7496

# Local Proxy Bridge (Optional - for better connection management)
# If you want to use the proxy bridge, uncomment and it will be tried first
# IB_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:5055

# Connection timeout in milliseconds
IBKR_TIMEOUT=10000

# Authentication tokens (if using secured proxy)
# IB_PROXY_TOKEN=your_token_here
# IB_BRIDGE_TOKEN=your_bridge_token_here

# Enable mock options data for development (set to true to use mock data)
USE_MOCK_OPTIONS=true

# Note: The system will automatically fallback between Gateway and TWS
# if one is not available, ensuring continuous connectivity
